   <p>
	These pages are all about XSLT, an XML-based language for translating one set of XML into another set of XML, or into HTML.  Of course, there are all sorts of <my:link href="#links">other pages</my:link>	around that cover XSLT.  Jeni's XSLT Pages, though, are dedicated to helping people understand and make the most of using XSLT.
</p>
   <p>
	My warmest thanks to all those people who post interesting problems on <my:link href="http://www.mulberytech.com/xsl/xsl-list/">XSL-List</my:link>, and 	especially to those of you that have encouraged me to set up this site through your kind emails.
