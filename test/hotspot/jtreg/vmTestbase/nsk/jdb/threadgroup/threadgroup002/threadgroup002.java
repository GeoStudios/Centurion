 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdb/threadgroup/threadgroup002.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdb]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DECSRIPTION
 *  This is a test for jdb 'threadgroup <threadgroup_name>' command.
 *  The main thread creates 3 threadgroups of 5 threads each.
 *  All threads are locked in their 'run' method on a lock that the main
 *  thread holds. The test passes if jdb correctly switches between
 *  three user-defined threadgroups using 'threadgroup' command.
 * COMMENTS
 *  This test functionally equals to nsk/jdb/threadgroup/threadgroup001
 *  test and replaces it.
 *
 * @library /vmTestbase
