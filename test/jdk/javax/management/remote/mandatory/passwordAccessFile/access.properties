# Access control file for Remote JMX API access to MBeanServer resources.
# This file defines the allowed access for different roles.

# The file format for the access file is syntactically the same as the
# Properties file format.  The syntax is described in the Javadoc for
# java.util.Properties.load.

# A typical access file has multiple lines, where each line is blank,
# a comment (like this one), or an access control entry.

# An access control entry consists of a role name, and an associated access
# level. The role name is any string that does not itself contain spaces or
# tabs. It corresponds to an entry in the password file. The access level
# is one of the following:
#
#       "readonly"  grants access to read attributes of MBeans.
#                   For monitoring, this means that a remote client in this
#                   role can read measurements but cannot perform any action
#                   that changes the environment of the running program.
#
#       "readwrite" grants access to read and write attributes of MBeans, to
#                   invoke operations on them, and to create or remove them.
#                   This access should be only granted to trusted clients,
#                   since they can potentially interfere with the smooth
#                   operation of a running program.

# A given role should have at most one entry in this file. If a role has no
# entry, it has no access.
# If multiple entries are found for the same role name, then the last access
# entry is used.

# Access rights granted to the authenticated identity by the RMI connector
# in this example.
