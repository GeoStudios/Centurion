     * example -- will _not_ clone those children unless a "deep clone"
     * has been requested. A shallow clone of an Attr node will yield an
     * empty Attr of the same name.

     * NOTE: Clones will always be read/write, even if the node being cloned
     * is read-only, to permit applications using only the DOM API to obtain
     * editable copies of locked portions of the tree.
