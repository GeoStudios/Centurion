/**
 * This is a "smart" variable reference that is used in situations where
 * an absolute path is optimized into a variable reference, but may
 * be used in some situations where the document context may have changed.
 * For instance, in select="document(doc/@href)//name[//salary &gt; 7250]", the
 * root in the predicate will be different for each node in the set.  While
 * this is easy to detect statically in this case, in other cases static
 * detection would be very hard or impossible.  So, this class does a dynamic check
 * to make sure the document context of the referenced variable is the same as
 * the current document context, and, if it is not, execute the referenced variable's
 * expression with the current context instead.
