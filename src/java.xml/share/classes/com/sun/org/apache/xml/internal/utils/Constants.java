   * URI which indicates that a name may be an XSLT directive. In most
   * XSLT stylesheets, this is bound to the "xsl:" prefix. It's defined
   * by the W3C's XSLT Recommendation.</li>

   * used in early prototypes of XSLT processors for much the same purpose
   * as S_XSLNAMESPACEURL. It is now considered obsolete, and the version
