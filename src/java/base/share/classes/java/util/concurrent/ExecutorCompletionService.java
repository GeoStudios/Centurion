/**
 * A {@link CompletionService} that uses a supplied {@link Executor}
 * to execute tasks.  This class arranges that submitted tasks are,
 * upon completion, placed on a queue accessible using {@code take}.
 * The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use
 * when processing groups of tasks.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Usage Examples.</b>
 *
 * Suppose you have a set of solvers for a certain problem, each
 * returning a value of some type {@code Result}, and would like to
 * run them concurrently, processing the results of each of them that
 * return a non-null value, in some method {@code use(Result r)}. You
 * could write this as:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * void solve(Executor e,
 *            Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
 *   CompletionService<Result> cs
 *       = new ExecutorCompletionService<>(e);
 *   solvers.forEach(cs::submit);
 *   for (int i = solvers.size(); i > 0; i--) {
 *     Result r = cs.take().get();
 *     if (r != null)
 *       use(r);
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Suppose instead that you would like to use the first non-null result
 * of the set of tasks, ignoring any that encounter exceptions,
 * and cancelling all other tasks when the first one is ready:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * void solve(Executor e,
 *            Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException {
 *   CompletionService<Result> cs
 *       = new ExecutorCompletionService<>(e);
 *   int n = solvers.size();
 *   List<Future<Result>> futures = new ArrayList<>(n);
 *   Result result = null;
 *   try {
 *     solvers.forEach(solver -> futures.add(cs.submit(solver)));
 *     for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
 *       try {
 *         Result r = cs.take().get();
 *         if (r != null) {
 *           result = r;
 *           break;
 *         }
 *       } catch (ExecutionException ignore) {}
 *     }
 *   } finally {
 *     futures.forEach(future -> future.cancel(true));
 *   }
 *
 *   if (result != null)
 *     use(result);
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * @param <V> the type of values the tasks of this service produce and consume
