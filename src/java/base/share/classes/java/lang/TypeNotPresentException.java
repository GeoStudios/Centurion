/**
 * Thrown when an application tries to access a type using a string

 * {@link ClassNotFoundException} in that {@code ClassNotFoundException} is a
 * checked exception, whereas this exception is unchecked.
 *
 * <p>Note that this exception may be used when undefined type variables
 * are accessed as well as when types (e.g., classes, interfaces or
 * annotation types) are loaded.
 * In particular, this exception can be thrown by the {@linkplain
 * java.base.share.classes.java.lang.reflect.AnnotatedElement API used to read annotations
