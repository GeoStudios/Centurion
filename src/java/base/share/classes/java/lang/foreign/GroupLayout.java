 * A compound layout that aggregates multiple <em>member layouts</em>. There are two ways in which member layouts
 * can be combined: if member layouts are laid out one after the other, the resulting group layout is said to be a <em>struct layout</em>
 * (see {@link MemoryLayout#structLayout(MemoryLayout...)}); conversely, if all member layouts are laid out at the same starting offset,
 * the resulting group layout is said to be a <em>union layout</em> (see {@link MemoryLayout#unionLayout(MemoryLayout...)}).
