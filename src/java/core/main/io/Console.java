/**
 * Methods to access the character-based console device, if any, associated
 * with the current Java virtual machine.
 *
 * <p> Whether a virtual machine has a console is dependent upon the
 * underlying platform and also upon the manner in which the virtual
 * machine is invoked.  If the virtual machine is started from an
 * interactive command line without redirecting the standard input and
 * output streams then its console will exist and will typically be
 * connected to the keyboard and display from which the virtual machine
 * was launched.  If the virtual machine is started automatically, for
 * example by a background job scheduler, then it may not
 * have a console.
 * <p>
 * If this virtual machine has a console then it is represented by a
 * unique instance of this class which can be obtained by invoking the
 * {@link java.lang.System#console()} method.  If no console device is
 * available then an invocation of that method will return {@code null}.
 * <p>
 * Read and write operations are synchronized to guarantee the atomic
 * completion of critical operations; therefore invoking methods.
 * <p>
 * Invoking {@code close()} on the objects returned by the {@link #reader()}
 * and the {@link #writer()} will not close the underlying stream of those
 * objects.
 * <p>
 * The console-read methods return {@code null} when the end of the
 * console input stream is reached, for example by typing control-D on
 * Unix or control-Z on Windows.  Subsequent read operations will succeed
 * if additional characters are later entered on the console's input
 * device.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to any method
 * in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 * <p>
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>{@code
 * Console cons;
 * char[] passwd;
 * if ((cons = System.console()) != null &&
 *     (passwd = cons.readPassword("[%s]", "Password:")) != null) {
 *     ...
 *     java.util.Arrays.fill(passwd, ' ');
 * }
 * }</pre></blockquote>
