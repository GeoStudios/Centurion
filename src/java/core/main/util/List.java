/**
 * An ordered collection (also known as a <i>sequence</i>).  The user of this
 * interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
 * inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
 * the list), and search for elements in the list.<p>
 *
 * Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
 * lists typically allow pairs of elements {@code e1} and {@code e2}
 * such that {@code e1.equals(e2)}, and they typically allow multiple
 * null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
 * that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
 * throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
 * expect this usage to be rare.<p>
 *
 * The {@code List} interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * specified in the {@code Collection} interface, on the contracts of the
 * {@code iterator}, {@code add}, {@code remove}, {@code equals}, and
 * {@code hashCode} methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.<p>
 *
 * The {@code List} interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
 * access to list elements.  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note
 * that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
 * for some implementations (the {@code LinkedList} class, for
 * example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
 * preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
 * implementation.<p>
 *
 * The {@code List} interface provides a special iterator, called a
 * {@code ListIterator}, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
 * bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the
 * {@code Iterator} interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
 * list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.<p>
 *
 * The {@code List} interface provides two methods to search for a specified
 * object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
 * caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear
 * searches.<p>
 *
 * The {@code List} interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
 * remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.<p>
 *
 * Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,
 * extreme caution is advised: the {@code equals} and {@code hashCode}
 * methods are no longer well defined on such a list.
 *
 * <p>Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <h2><a id="unmodifiable">Unmodifiable Lists</a></h2>
 * <p>The {@link java.core.main.util.List(Object...) List.of} and
 * {@link java.core.main.util.List List.copyOf} static factory methods
 * provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable lists. The {@code List}
 * instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>They are <a href="Collection.html#unmodifiable"><i>unmodifiable</i></a>. Elements cannot
 * be added, removed, or replaced. Calling any mutator method on the List
 * will always cause {@code UnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
 * However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable,
 * this may cause the List's contents to appear to change.
 * <li>They disallow {@code null} elements. Attempts to create them with
 * {@code null} elements result in {@code NullPointerException}.
 * <li>They are serializable if all elements are serializable.
 * <li>The order of elements in the list is the same as the order of the
 * provided arguments, or of the elements in the provided array.
 * <li>The lists and their views implement the
 * {@link java.util.RandomAccess} interface.
 * <li>They are <a href="../lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
 * Programmers should treat instances that are {@linkplain (Object) equal}
 * as interchangeable and should not use them for synchronization, or
 * unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,
 * synchronization may fail. Callers should make no assumptions about the
 * identity of the returned instances. Factories are free to
 * create new instances or reuse existing ones.
 * <li>They are serialized as specified on the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/serialized-form.html#java.util.CollSer">Serialized Form</a>
 * page.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
