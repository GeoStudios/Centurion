/**
 * A collection of methods for performing low-level, unsafe operations.
 * Although the class and all methods are public, use of this class is
 * limited because only trusted code can obtain instances of it.
 *
 * <em>Note:</em> It is the responsibility of the caller to make sure
 * arguments are checked before methods of this class are
 * called. While some rudimentary checks are performed on the input,
 * the checks are best effort and when performance is an overriding
 * priority, as when methods of this class are optimized by the
 * runtime compiler, some or all checks (if any) may be elided. Hence,
 * the caller must not rely on the checks and corresponding
 * exceptions!

     * <p>The returned {@code Unsafe} object should be carefully guarded
     * by the caller, since it can be used to read and write data at arbitrary
     * memory addresses.  It must never be passed to untrusted code.
     *
     * <p>Most methods in this class are very low-level, and correspond to a
     * small number of hardware instructions (on typical machines).  Compilers
     * are encouraged to optimize these methods accordingly.
     *
     * <p>Here is a suggested idiom for using unsafe operations:

     * <pre> {@code
     * class MyTrustedClass {
     *   private static final Unsafe unsafe = Unsafe.getUnsafe();
     *   ...
     *   private long myCountAddress = ...;
     *   public int getCount() { return unsafe.getByte(myCountAddress); }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * (It may assist compilers to make the local variable {@code final}.)
