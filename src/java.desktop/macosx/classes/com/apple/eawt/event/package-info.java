/**
 * Classes for receiving gesture events. Provides a mechanism to receive various
 * gesture events on JComponents. Gesture notifications are relayed up the
 * component hierarchy from the deepest component under the cursor to the
 * top-level container. Events may be consumed by deeper components to prevent
 * them from propagating to higher components. Gesture listeners are added to
 * components using the GestureUtilities helper class.
