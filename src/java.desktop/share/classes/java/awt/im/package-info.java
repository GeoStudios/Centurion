/**
 * Provides classes and interfaces for the input method framework. This package
 * enables text editing components to receive text input through input methods.
 * Input methods are software components that let the user enter text in ways
 * other than simple typing on a keyboard. They are commonly used to enter
 * Japanese, Chinese, or Korean - languages using thousands of different
 * characters - on keyboards with far fewer keys. However, the framework also
 * supports input methods for other languages and the use of entirely different
 * input mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.
