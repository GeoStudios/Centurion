/**
 * This interface represents a document with a CSS view.
 * <p> The <code>getOverrideStyle</code> method provides a mechanism through
 * which a DOM author could effect immediate change to the style of an
 * element without modifying the explicitly linked style sheets of a
 * document or the inline style of elements in the style sheets. This style
 * sheet comes after the author style sheet in the cascade algorithm and is
 * called override style sheet. The override style sheet takes precedence
 * over author style sheets. An "!important" declaration still takes
 * precedence over a normal declaration. Override, author, and user style
 * sheets all may contain "!important" declarations. User "!important" rules
 * take precedence over both override and author "!important" rules, and
 * override "!important" rules take precedence over author "!important"
 * rules.
 * <p> The expectation is that an instance of the <code>DocumentCSS</code>
 * interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an
 * instance of the <code>Document</code> interface.
 * <p>See also the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113'>Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification</a>.
