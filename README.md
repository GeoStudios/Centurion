Centurion is soon to be a Heavy JDK to supply the user with great library of Java tools and enhancements 
for the java enviorment. 

:warning: Centurion is in alpha stages right now and might have bugs. If any bugs occur, make a [Issue.](https://github.com/GeoStudios/Centurion/issues)

:warning: {Java.base} code will be removed on version Alpha 1.5 or on May 26th. Its about 90% of the errors and
is 90% of the code so it makes sense. It will be replaced with a much better and more relaxed form of base code 
for all OS's.  

We will be making a site for the devlopment which will have all the downloads and extra info 
you to see. Prob this summer! The site is going to have a wiki with all the versions and all 
the info for this gigantic project.
