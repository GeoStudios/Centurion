Centurion is soon to be a Heavy JDK to supply the user with great library of Java tools and enhancements 
for the java enviorment. 

:warning: Centurion is in alpha stages right now and might have bugs. If any bugs occur, make a [Issue.](https://github.com/GeoStudios/Centurion/issues)

:warning: This whole repo will be revamped and no longer compatable with any offical JDK. The offical JDK has issues that are completly wrecking Centurion to the extent of revamping.

We will be making a site for the devlopment which will have all the downloads and extra info 
you to see. Prob this summer! The site is going to have a wiki with all the versions and all 
the info for this gigantic project.
