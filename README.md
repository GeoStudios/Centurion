# Geo-Studios: Powerful Java Development Kit

## What is it?

**Centurion** is to be a Java Development by providing a set of tools, sets, algorithms, 
and much more to help developers create their own programs. It uses its own set of tools
from its own math unit to its 64-bit arrays, sets and list, IO classes for binary and text
files, and much more.

Centurion is a project that is being developed by Geo-Studios, a group of developers that
are working on a variety of projects. Be patient with us as we only have 3 developers working
on this project. 

Since version 0.1, Centurion has been put into a single jar for a library purpose of right now.
We are in Alpha right now and that means we are working on only the Java files and soon the rest
of the build and scripting files will be added to Beta.

If you want to use the jar, you can put it into the external library's tab since its built
to be a library at this moment.
