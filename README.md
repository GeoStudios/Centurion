Centurion is to be a Java Development Kit to supply the user with a huge library, and a functional tool
to use when developing java projects, programs, and much more!

Centurion is starting to be built right now and is going to take many months to craft a functional installable 
program for its users.

:warning: This JDK will not be compatible with any existing JDK due to the fact that any changes from them could
potentially break Centurion.

GeoStudios is soon going to be launching a site that houses versions for the all the products of GeoStudios and 
will be housing Centurion sometime afterward. Please be patient in this process due to the fact we only have 2 
devs making this possible working voluntary on this project.
